# ScoreIt.AI
An AI based resume scorer, which utilizes AI techniques like OCR &amp; NER for resume matching, scrapes job descriptions from job links and runs an algorithm on resume against the job description and scores it on the basis of similarity found between the both. Also, it incorporates LLM models to give AI suggestions on what to improve in the resume.
